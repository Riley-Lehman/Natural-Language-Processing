# Unit 6 - Natural Language Processing Project

## Introduction

Natural language processing (NLP) is used in many apps and devices to interact with users and make meaning of text to determine how to respond, find information, or to create new text. Your goal is to use natural language processing techniques to identify structure, patterns, and meaning in a text to have conversations with a user, execute commands, perform manipulations on the text, or generate new text.

## Requirements

Use your knowledge of object-oriented programming, ArrayLists, the String class, and algorithms to create a program that uses natural language processing techniques:

- **Create at least two ArrayLists** – Create at least two ArrayLists to store the data used in your program, such as data from text files or entered by the user.
- **Implement one or more algorithms** – Implement one or more algorithms that use loops and conditionals to find or manipulate elements in an ArrayList or String object.
- **Use methods in the String classs** - Use one or more methods in the String class in your program, such as to divide text into sentences or phrases.
- **Use at least one natural language processing technique** – Use a natural language processing technique to process, analyze, and/or generate text.
- **Document your code** – Use comments to explain the purpose of the methods and code segments and note any preconditions and postconditions.

## Project Description

The goal of our code is to take an input from a source (reader / user) and find that word in an incode text file, then the code will print the definition of the word if it is found, if not found, it will print I can not find this word. There are two text files in our code, one for definitions, and one for the words that the code needs to match. Inputs like the word the, store, blink, etc are what the code would search for in the text files.
